<h1 align="center">Test of Bootstrap</h1>
<h2 align="center">Summary</h2>
This repo was created to document my first use of Bootstrap.
This code is obviously open-sourced so you are free to use it as you wish.
There is no need for credit to be given since all this code is open-sourced and was part of my learning experience of learning Bootstrap. I don't want to impeded on your learning experience so all of this code is open-sourced.
<h2>Installation</h2>
$git clone --recursive https://github.com/jzhong653/Templar-Game
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this index.html code is for the elements of the page to remain where they are even if the webpage is moving around. This allows for elements to be more easily hidden when the webpage gets smaller and no distortion effect to occur due to the window being resized.
