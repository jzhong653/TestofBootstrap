<h1 align="center">Test of Bootstrap</h1>
<h2 align="center">Summary</h2>
This repo was created to document my first use of Bootstrap.
This code is obviously open-sourced so you are free to use it as you wish.
There is no need for credit to be given since all this code is open-sourced and was part of my learning experience of learning Bootstrap. I don't want to impeded on your learning experience so all of this code is open-sourced.
